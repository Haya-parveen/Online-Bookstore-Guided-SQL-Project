# Online-Bookstore-Guided-SQL-Project
Built my first SQL project by following a guided tutorial. Created a PostgreSQL database with Books, Customers, and Orders tables, imported CSV data, and wrote 20+ queries to analyze stock, revenue, customer behavior, and book trends. Strengthened core SQL concepts through hands-on practice.
