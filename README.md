# 📚 Online Bookstore – SQL Portfolio Project

This guided project simulates a real-world bookstore database and was a key milestone in my SQL learning journey. Using PostgreSQL, I created and explored a relational database by writing practical queries to solve realistic business scenarios.

## 🗃️ Database Design

The project is structured with 3 interrelated tables:

- **Books**: Details like title, author, genre, published year, price, and stock  
- **Customers**: Basic customer info including city and country  
- **Orders**: Order history with date, quantity, and total purchase value

## 🔍 Queries & Business Insights

I wrote 20+ SQL queries to uncover key insights, such as:

- 📊 Total revenue and top-selling books  
- 📚 Popular genres and most ordered authors  
- 💰 High-spending and repeat customers  
- 🏷️ Books with lowest stock and remaining inventory  
- 📦 Cities with frequent purchases and order volume

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

- Database creation and table relationships  
- SQL querying using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `COALESCE`  
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`  
- Data filtering, sorting, and combining logic for analysis
